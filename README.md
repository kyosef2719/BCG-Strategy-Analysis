# BCG Strategic Marketing & ROI Analysis 
**Framework:** Strategy Consulting & Data-Driven Attribution  
**Status:** Completed (BCG Virtual Experience 2025)

## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal of this analysis was to advise a global client on their marketing spend optimization. The client needed to know which specific channel (Email, Instagram, or Webinar) was most effective at acquiring **New Customers** to maximize their ROI.

## 📊 The Challenge
With multiple campaigns running simultaneously, the client faced "data noise." They needed to move beyond vanity metrics (likes/clicks) and identify actual **Sales Revenue** attributed to specific new customer segments.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Processed raw campaign data to isolate "New Customer" transactions.
2. **Segmentation:** Filtered performance by Channel and Campaign Type.
3. **Attribution Modeling:** Utilized Pivot Table analysis to calculate the total sales volume for each touchpoint.

## 💡 Strategic Insights
* **Primary Revenue Engine:** The analysis clearly identified **Email + Campaign A** as the leader, generating **$2,124.47 in sales**.
* **Underperforming Channels:** Despite high social presence, Instagram and Webinars lagged in direct "New Customer" conversion.
* **The "So What?":** The data suggests that for this specific demographic, direct-to-inbox marketing is 2x more effective than social-first strategies.

## 🚀 Business Recommendation
I recommended a **20% budget shift** from Instagram organic content to **Targeted Email Campaign A**. By focusing on the highest-grossing channel, the client can lower their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) while increasing total sales volume.
